🚀 Mini Project: Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning 🎗️

In this mini project, I built a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using various techniques.

🔍 Project Highlights:
✅ Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
✅ Used Random Forest to identify the most important features
✅ Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and better visualization
✅ Implemented K-Means Clustering for unsupervised learning
✅ Trained a Random Forest Classifier to achieve high accuracy
✅ Simulated survival prediction using Logistic Regression
